GravitySimulator
================

See a live example on JS Fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/uSJbm/14/

This was heavily inspired by PlayfulJS - you should check it out - it's a lot of fun.

This is a simulator that has basic gravity equations.  It's configured with realistic mass and distnace values for our solar system, which I got from wikipedia.

It also has a bunch of random celestial bodies, like comets and asteriods, and a cloud of space junk around Jupiter.

It supports various viewports.  

Spacebar - toggles 'tracing' on or off.  with this on, you can make some awesome spyrographs.
'<' and '>' - zoom in and out.  
'h' - returns the viewport to the home zoom level centered on the sun.
'f' - shifts which celestial body is fixed as the center of the view. 

There are more, but those are the big ones.....
