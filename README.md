## About

This is a gravity-particle sandbox.  It comes with a default configuration for our solar system using masses, and distances I researched from from wikipedia.  It also has a bunch of random celestial bodies, like comets and asteriods, and a cloud of space junk around Jupiter.

It uses newtonian gravity equations.

## Instructions

Download the locally open up particles.html in a browser.  
It doesn't require a build, or a server, or any libraries.

It has a splash screen to tell you about all of the interactions it supports.

Play around with it and enjoy.

## Versions
